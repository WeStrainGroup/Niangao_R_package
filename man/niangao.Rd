\title{Process single-end AB1 files for sequence cleaning.}
\usage{
niangao(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
containing the AB1 files.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item{\code{result_table}}{A data frame summarizing the processing results for
each file, including raw and cleaned sequence lengths, average quality scores,
and counts of deleted bases during cleaning.}
\item{\code{dna_string_set}}{A \code{DNAStringSet} object containing all cleaned
sequences, where each sequence corresponds to a file processed.}
}
}
\description{
This function processes AB1 files from a specified directory, cleans the sequences
based on quality scores using a sliding window algorithm, and returns a summary
table alongside a \code{DNAStringSet} object containing all cleaned sequences.
}
\details{
The cleaning process involves:
\itemize{
\item Calculating quality scores using a sliding window algorithm to filter out
low-quality regions.
\item Identifying and retaining the longest high-quality continuous segment.
\item Removing bases with quality scores below a specified threshold (default: 30).
}

Files without valid sequences after cleaning are excluded from the \code{DNAStringSet} object.

# Example usage:
file_path <- "path/to/your/ab1/files"
results <- niangao(file_path)

# Access results:
print(results$result_table)  # View the summary table
print(results$dna_string_set)  # View the DNAStringSet object
}
